        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A 3 ingredient, 3 step recipe that is definitely a winner-winner.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds skin-on chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons adobo seasoning, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a rack on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place chicken, skin-side down, on the rack. Liberally sprinkle with adobo seasoning. Turn chicken over, brush olive oil on skin, and liberally sprinkle with adobo.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
